# 📦 Logistics and Customer Satisfaction Analysis

## Overview
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of logistics operations and customer satisfaction using **Excel**, **Python**, **Microsoft Access**, and **Power BI**. The objective was to identify inefficiencies, uncover performance patterns, and generate actionable insights to inform business decisions in a logistics-driven environment.

---

## 🔍 Key Objectives
- Analyze operational metrics: shipping time, distribution centres, logistics costs, and customer satisfaction.
- Explore variable relationships through correlation analysis.
- Detect cost and performance inconsistencies across the dataset.
- Visualize data and relationships for clear insight communication.
- Deliver strategic recommendations based on data patterns.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Excel** – Data cleaning, descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation), correlation analysis.
- **Python** *(Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)* – Data preprocessing, statistical analysis, correlation heatmaps, visual exploration.
- **Microsoft Access** – Relational data management and structured queries.
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboards and data visualizations (shipping trends, customer satisfaction, cost metrics).

---

## 📈 Insights & Outcomes
- **Shipping time and logistics costs** showed high variability, indicating operational inconsistency.
- **Customer satisfaction** was consistent and **not significantly affected** by shipping delays or spending.
- **Weak correlation** between distribution centres and logistics costs highlighted the need for **efficiency-focused infrastructure**, not simply expansion.
- Data visualizations clarified trends and supported recommendations for **cost reduction without compromising service quality**.

---

## 💡 Applications
- Optimize logistics spending without negatively impacting customer satisfaction.
- Guide infrastructure investment using data (e.g., evaluating where new distribution centres are truly needed).
- Improve strategic planning and reporting with interactive dashboards.
- Enhance customer experience by focusing on reliability and service quality rather than speed alone.
